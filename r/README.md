Files in this repository calculate the MLSN guideline from input data sets.

Run `read_data_and_calculate_mlsn.R` to generate the guidelines.

See the `functions.R` file for the MLSN calculation functions.

See the `data/README.md` file for a description of the data files.

There were n = 3721 samples at the time the MLSN guidelines were updated in August 2014 for the preparation of the CSSA abstract on updating the guidelines (https://scisoc.confex.com/scisoc/2014am/webprogram/Paper86244.html). We work with n = 3683 in this paper because we omit all samples for the Global Soil Survey.
