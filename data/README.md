### About these data

We gathered data from soil nutrient analyses of professionally-managed turf, primarily from golf courses but also from athletic fields and lawns. 

Prior to inclusion in this dataset, PACE Turf and ATC samples were manually filtered to remove any samples collected from problem areas, poor-performing turf, research projects, and topdressing sand. Thus, all samples in this dataset represent soil nutrient levels from professionally-managed turf that was performing well at the time the sample was collected. 

All samples were tested at Brookside Laboratories (New Bremen, Ohio).

### PACE data

The `pace_samples.csv` file contains test results from soil samples collected to a 10 cm depth and submitted to PACE Turf from October 1991 to August 2014.

### ATC data

The `atc_samples.csv` file contains test results from soil samples collected to a 10 cm depth and submitted to ATC from March 2007 to July 2014. These samples were collected from good performing turfgrass sites in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Japan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. Grass species growing at these sites include *Cynodon* spp., *Paspalum vaginatum*, *Zoysia japonica*, *Zoysia matrella*, *Agrostis stolonifera*, and *Lolium perenne*.
